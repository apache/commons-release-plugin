<a name="sig"><h2>Signatures</h2></a>

<p>Many of the files have been digitally signed using GnuPG.  If so,
    there will be an accompanying <samp><em>file</em>.asc</samp> signature
    file in the same directory as the file (binaries/ or source/).  The
    signing keys can be found in the distribution directory at &lt;<a
            HREF="https://downloads.apache.org/commons/KEYS"><samp>https://downloads.apache.org/commons/KEYS</samp></a>&gt;.</p>

<p><b>Always download the KEYS file directly from the Apache site, never from a mirror site.</b></p>


<pre>Always test available signatures, <i>e.g.</i>,
$ pgpk -a KEYS
$ pgpv ${artifactId}-${version}-bin.tar.gz.asc
or,
$ pgp -ka KEYS
$ pgp ${artifactId}-${version}-bin.tar.gz.asc
or,
$ gpg --import KEYS
$ gpg --verify ${artifactId}-${version}-bin.tar.gz.asc
</pre>
